This projects aims to utilize the novel technique of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the complex differential equations involved in Linear Elasticity.
Postion dependent body forces are applied on to a 2D object of any random shape and the model calculates the displacements and stress tensor at every point on the body.
